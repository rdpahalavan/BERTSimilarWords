# BERTSimilarWords
## Find Similar Words using BERT

BERTSimilarWords is a python library that is used to find similar words using BERT. It uses a pre-trained BERT base model (cased) and cosine similarity to find the closest neighbor to the given words.

BERT generates contextual word embeddings, so the word embedding for the same word will differ based on its context. For example, the word **Apple** in *"Apple is a good fruit"* and *"Apple is a good phone"* have different word embeddings. Generating word embeddings for all vocabulary in the English language based on context is time-consuming and needs many resources. So, this library requires the vocabulary for generating word embeddings beforehand.

Vocabularies used to generate word embeddings can be given in two ways:

* Using Wikipedia pages
* Using text files (.docx and .txt)

## Install

Install the library using
```
pip install BERTSimilarWords
```

Import it using
```python
>>> from BERTSimilarWords import BERTSimilarWords
```

## Providing the vocabularies

### Using Wikipedia pages
